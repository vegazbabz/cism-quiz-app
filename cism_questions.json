A is incorrect because, although information security policies are an essential part of information security governance, there are several other components to governance as well. B is incorrect because security policies and activities (such as audits) to measure their effectiveness are only one component of information security governance. D is incorrect because the comparison of metrics to other organizations is not a significant part of a governance program. Indeed, many organizations forego benchmarking entirely."

    "explanation": "An effective TPRM program captures and archives detailed information about security controls in third-party service-provider organizations. This helps a CISO better understand the overall world of risk with regard to the protection of critical data and capabilities. B, C, and D are incorrect. B is incorrect because TPRM provides little, if any , insight into procurement. This is because TPRM does not include activities such as competitive analysis, suitability of services, or pricing, which are among the matters of focus by procurement. C is incorrect because a TPRM process does not necessarily provide a list of all of an organization's service providers. This is because individuals and groups may still procure low-cost or free services and “fly under the radar ” of IT , security , legal, and procurement processes and put the organization at risk. D is incorrect because a TPRM process focuses on information security risk in third-party service- provider organizations, which is a high-value concern for a CISO."

A description of the deficiency in the vulnerability management process should lead Jacqueline to one of the dynamic interconnections, emer gence, enabling and support, and governing. In this case, the process deficiency is related to the frequency of scans, which is most likely the governing DI.

C is incorrect because this answer does not include budget (operating costs), which is among the most important considerations, as budget enables the security manager to acquire staff and tooling to address risks."

    "explanation": "The best first step for understanding the current state of an organization's information security program is to perform a comprehensive baseline risk assessment. This is the best answer because a risk assessment takes the broadest assessment of the state of information risk, along with the state of any existing controls. A, B, and D are incorrect. A is incorrect because a code review is a consideration of a very narrow portion of the overall state of the organization's information security program. At best, a code review will assess the state of the organization's secure-by-design practices, as well as the effectiveness of safe development training for its developers. Virtually every other aspect of the organization's information security program is ignored. B is incorrect because, although the risk register may indeed contain valuable information about many risks in the organization, it is not a good indicator of the state of existing security tooling and processes in the organization. Indeed, the risk register itself may be woefully incomplete, it may be out of date, or it may be inaccurate. D is incorrect because a penetration test provides a narrow viewpoint of the overall state of the organization's information security program. Although a penetration test may be a good assessment of an organization's vulnerability management and system hardening practices, it completely overlooks the majority of activities needed in today's information security programs."

B, C, and D are incorrect. B is incorrect because a threat assessment takes a different, and broader , view than preventive controls. For instance, it's possible that there are reasonable threat scenarios for which no controls exist to reduce those threats'  impact or probability of occurrence. C is incorrect because a threat assessment does not take a vulnerability-centric approach. A threat assessment starts with threat actors and various scenarios. Once a threat assessment has been completed, the vulnerabilities can be identified and remediated. D is incorrect because this is not the best answer. Although it is true that a threat assessment's role is to identify risks, a threat assessment does not identify all risks."

Taking a risk-based approach is sensible because this serves to remediate findings by addressing the highest-risk findings first. A, B, and C are incorrect. A is incorrect because correlation with a penetration test would rarely be a prudent next step (unless the internal audit was solely focused on security configuration of target systems). B is incorrect because compensating controls are not the “go-to ” remedy for curing control ineffectiveness; in some cases, compensating controls may be used, but this is not a typical approach.

    "question": "An organization's CISO is planning for the cybersecurity budget for the following year. One of the security analysts informed the CISO that she should add more licenses to the vulnerability scanning tool so that all of the organization's networks can be scanned; currently , there are only enough licenses to scan the primary on-premises data center , but not the secondary data center , office networks, or external-facing assets. How should the CISO respond to this request?",

      "A": "The CISO should expand licensing for the vulnerability scanning tool to include all internal and external networks. Many vulnerability scanning tools maintain databases that track the history of vulnerabilities for each asset; expanding licensing to include all networks will enable this feature to be used",
      "B": "No additional licenses are needed, since only the data center network needs to be scanned.",

Many vulnerability scanning tools maintain databases that track the history of vulnerabilities for each asset; expanding licensing to include all networks will enable this feature to be used. B, C, and D are incorrect. B is incorrect because licenses should be increased to include all internal and external networks and not just the primary data center. C is incorrect because the licensing limitation will mean that reconfiguring the scanning tool to scan various internal networks will destroy valuable scanning and remediation history , depriving the security team of the history of scans, vulnerabilities, and remediation for every asset. D is incorrect because the addition of the secondary data center , though a move in the right direction, is insufficient; the scanning tool should be licensed to scan all assets in all internal and external networks."

There are dozens of configuration settings, which should be applied gradually rather than all at once. Implementing these changes of configuration in test environments first ensures that configuration changes do not adversely af fect production systems. A, C, and D are incorrect. A is incorrect because implementing all of the configuration changes in CIS Benchmarks all at once is likely to result in server or application malfunctions that may be difficult to troubleshoot, since so many changes will have been made at one time. C and D are incorrect because it is not a good practice to implement server configuration changes in production environments without first testing those changes in test environments."

A, B, and C are incorrect. A is incorrect because this is not the best answer. Although the number of firewall rules triggered may signal the level of unwanted network activity , there is not necessarily a strong correlation between this and the likelihood of an attack. This is because the likelihood of a successful attack is more dependent on other conditions such as patch levels and login credentials. B is incorrect because this is not the best answer.

B, C, and D are incorrect. B is incorrect because an organization cannot simply enact new controls in another organization. Only the third-party organization can make changes to its operations, including changes to existing controls and the enactment of new controls. C is incorrect because the initiation of contract negotiations during the term of a contract is often not fruitful. However , if a contract is about to expire and be renewed, that may be a good opportunity to bring new language into the agreement between the organization and its third-party service provider.

A is incorrect because the identification of security requirements just prior to implementation removes the opportunity to select a software service provider based upon its security capabilities (alongside all of its other capabilities). This also removes the opportunity to implement security controls and features in the service, since “just prior to implementation ” implies that controls, features, and capabilities have already been determined.

    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This objection, that the templates will lack the names of specific regulations that the organization is obligated to comply with, is the weakest objection to the use of templates and is therefore the correct answer. A, C, and D are incorrect. A is incorrect because the lack of specifics about business processes and technologies in use is a valid objection to the use of a template. It is critical that an incident response plan be very specific about existing business processes so that the steps in an incident response plan will properly call out existing processes in the steps to respond to a security incident. Similarly , it is critical that an incident response plan has specific information about the technologies in use, as incident response plan steps will often direct responders to utilize technology in place for troubleshooting, isolation, and mitigation. C is incorrect because the lack of specific names of departments and executives is a valid objection to the use of such a template. The names of specific departments are needed, so that incident responders understand which departments to work with during various stages of incident response. The names of executives are also useful, as executives do need to be informed about an incident in progress. D is incorrect because the lack of specific references to an organization's crisis response plan is a valid objection to such a template. A security incident response plan certainly needs to call out the organization's crisis response plan, as a highly severe security incident may need to trigger an organization's crisis response plan."

Further , one influence of the location of a system might be the selection of personnel to respond to an incident, but this is not a part of incident classification. A, C, and D are incorrect. A is incorrect because the volume of data involved in an incident is likely to influence the incident's classification, particularly if the data is sensitive. C is incorrect because the sensitivity of data involved in an incident is highly likely to influence the incident's classification because of the possibility that regulators, law enforcement, or af fected parties may need to be notified. D is incorrect because the operational criticality of a system is likely to influence the incident's classification."

    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The rule of forensic analysis tools is that they must be run on dedicated, isolated systems that are used for no other purpose. Only this will instill confidence that other activities cannot influence the outcome of forensic investigations. A, B, and C are incorrect. A is incorrect because theft risk is not a significant risk; still, it can be mitigated through secure storage of forensic computers. B is incorrect because this does not address the need for system isolation. C is incorrect because RAM capacity does not address the need for the forensic analysis system to be isolated from other activities."

    "explanation": "The selection of future incident response personnel is not likely to be included in a post-incident review. But on the topic of incident response personnel, issues of their training and knowledge may be discussed if there is a need for improvement. A, C, and D are incorrect. A is incorrect because a sound incident response post-incident review will include root-cause analysis to identify the root cause of the incident. C is incorrect because a post-incident review will strive to identify improvements in controls to increase awareness of an incident and reduce its impact and probability of occurrence. D is incorrect because a post-incident review attempts to find improvement opportunities in the incident review process itself."

    "question": "Which of the following techniques best describes the impact of a security incident on management?",
    "choices": {
      "A": "Hard costs and soft costs",
      "B": "Because the costs and impact of a security incident can vary, the best approach is to report on specific hard costs, including professional services, tooling, and equipment, as well as soft costs, including the labor hours by in-house staff, together with qualitative impacts such as market share or reputation damage that are difficult to quantify. A, C, and D are incorrect",
      "C": "The total of all outsourced professional services",

A, C, and D are incorrect. A is incorrect because hard costs and soft costs ignore qualitative impacts such as loss of market share and reputational damage. C is incorrect because the cost of outsourced services probably does not represent the totality of hard costs, and it does not represent qualitative impact such as reputation. D is incorrect because hardware replacement, when it is needed at all, is probably a small portion of the total cost of an incident."

      "C": "Sensitive information about an incident would be accessible to too few personnel.",
      "D": "The primary reason why an IT  service desk incident ticketing system would not be used for security incidents is the potential for highly sensitive information in the ticketing system being available to all service desk and other IT  personnel. A potential compromise is to record all incidents in the service desk ticketing system but store the most sensitive information (such as suspected personnel in an insider event or details about sensitive affected data or sensitive exploit information) elsewhere and reference it in the ticketing system"

    "explanation": "An enterprise-wide risk assessment is the best option here so that risks of all kinds can be identified and remedies suggested for mitigating them. B, C, and D are incorrect. B is incorrect because it's possible that there are missing controls; a controls maturity assessment takes too narrow a view here and focuses only on existing controls, when the problem might be controls that are nonexistent. C is incorrect because the nature of the incident is unknown and may not be related to technical vulnerabilities that a penetration test would reveal (for example, it may have been phishing or fraud).

A better solution would be the use of a system that would do this automatically , as well as retrieve any of fending messages already delivered to some users before the message was recognized as harmful. A, C, and D are incorrect. A is incorrect because this is not the best choice. However , depending on the nature of the threat (which is not revealed in this question), if the phishing is known to carry a malicious payload known to infect user machines successfully in the organization, then perhaps a high-severity incident is the right course of action. C is incorrect because this is not the best choice. However , in the absence of antiphishing controls, this may be the organization's best choice. D is incorrect because this is not the best choice; the adversary may be able to continue sending e-mails from different servers."
